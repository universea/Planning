# Planning

Path planning algorithms

Modified from: [https://github.com/zhm-real/PathPlanning.git](https://github.com/zhm-real/PathPlanning.git)

The main goal is to improve usability, where for 2D planning, only the map needs to be provided (pixel value 0: drivable area, >=1: obstacle).

## Credits

The code in this repository is based on the original implementation available at [https://github.com/zhm-real/PathPlanning.git](https://github.com/zhm-real/PathPlanning.git). It has been modified and enhanced for ease of use.

## Getting Started

To use the path planning algorithms in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Todo:

2. 2D planning:

For 2D planning, you need to provide a map where pixel values represent the drivable areas and obstacles. The drivable areas should have a pixel value of 0, while obstacles should have pixel values greater than or equal to 1.
